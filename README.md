# Concurrent-Port-Management-System
This was my OS Course (CS F372) project in this project I have :
Designed a multi-process Port Management System in C to schedule ship docking and resource allocation.
Implemented real-time, synchronized communication between concurrent processes using IPC mechanisms like shared memory and message queues.
Developed a priority-based scheduling algorithm to optimize dock and crane usage by handling concurrent requests with constraints.

The problem statement and all the constraints for the algorithm is mentioned in the OS ASSIGNMENT 2 pdf.
