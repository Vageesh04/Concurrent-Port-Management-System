# Concurrent-Port-Management-System
Designed a multi-process Port Management System in C to schedule ship docking and resource allocation.
Implemented real-time, synchronized communication between concurrent processes using IPC mechanisms like shared memory and message queues.
Developed a priority-based scheduling algorithm to optimize dock and crane usage by handling concurrent requests with constraints.
